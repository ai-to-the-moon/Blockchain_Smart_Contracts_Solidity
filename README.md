# Smart Contract Deposits and Withdrawals

The application in 'joint_savings.sol' contains a smart contract developed on [REMIX's IDE ](www.remix.org) that enables the user to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency between two different wallet addresses (and the smart contract itself). 

## Installation Guide

Downloading the code & associated files using `git clone` from the repository is sufficient to download the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that the associated libaries (see Technologies section) are installed on your machine as well.
